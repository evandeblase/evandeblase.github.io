## About Me

Hi, my name is Evan DeBlase. I am an alumnus of Lehigh University, holding a Bachelor of Science degree in Finance and Accounting, with a minor in Real Estate. My greatest strengths are my curious mind and determination as I search for ways to think differently and never get complacent with the growth of my abilities and passion.

_**[10K Sentiment and its Immediate Affect on Return](report)**_
<br>
<br>
This project was for a midterm assignment in my data science for finance course. I analyzed returns based on the sentiment of 10K reports. The analysis looked at the cumulative returns of stocks in the S&P500 immediately following the submission of their 10K. Split up into three different returns, we looked at 1-day, 3-day, and 10-day returns to see how the market reacted.
<br>
<br>
I then calculated the correlation between the two variables: sentiment and return. Sentiment was captures 10 different ways, searching a total of five different dictionaries. For example, the 'positive' term dictionaries searched 10K reports for 'positive' words and then assigned a score based on the volume of those words. I created three dictionaries based on different topics that may be discussed in the 10K report, and how positively or negatively they were talked about. The three dictionaries were based on the following: Litigation, Regulation, and Financing Terms.

_**[Congress Trades Dashboard](https://sus-congress.streamlit.app/)**_
<br>
<br>
This team project tracked the portfolios of congress members and their estimated returns. We estimated their portfolio value based on their buys and sells of stocks, since this is the only publicly available information. We also flagged trades for insider trading, based on whether or not the member sits on a committee that directly influences the legislation of a stock they buy. This project was for the final project in the Data Analytics for Finance class taught by Professor Donald Bowen at Lehigh University.

_**[Apartment Complex Valuation](/pdf/OldBridge_Valuation_Report_REAL348.pdf)**_
<br>
<br>
This project was the Real Estate minor at Lehigh's capstone requirement, and its goal was to provide judges with a detailed analysis of the property AvalonBay Old Bridge in Old Bridge, NJ. Myself and four other team members conducted three different valuation analyses. The project included a Sales Comparable, Discounted Cash Flow, and a Direct Capitalization analysis. We competed against a total of eight teams comprised of the students in the Real Estate minor. We proudly earned second place with this project, and it even more valuably provided the experience of market analysis and valuation for a real property.

## Career Objectives

The end-goal of my career is to say I was able to help others while staying focused on what interests me. I would like to focus my career on real estate development, and even further to residential development. I am interested in career paths that will allow me to into development or investment analysis, where I will be able to hone my skills while being able to say I love what I do.

## Hobbies

I enjoy everything adventurous and experiencing new things. Whether it be new ideas, new places, or pretty much new anything, I love learning and challenging myself to new things.
<br>
To be more specific about my hobbies, I enjoy anything outdoors; from hunting and fishing to hiking and camping. A fun fact about me is that I took a car-camping road trip from my home state of PA all the way to San Diego... and back! I also enjoy building things, most notably the card table my roommate and I built in the woodshop at Lehigh. I don't have many projects to my name, but I am currently working on a bookshelf.
<br>
Like most people, I value my time with friends and family, so I have to include them somewhere on my site. Any other hobbies I previously mentioned were things both my friends and family helped me enjoy doing!
