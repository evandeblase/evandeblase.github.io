## Career Objectives

The end-goal of my career is to say I was able to help others while staying focused on what interests me. My interests are in real estate as mentioned in my about me section, and a core value I live by is selflessness. 
<br>
A place to live is a universal need and I want to be able to provide that for people. I plan to break into this industry once I have built enough capital and relationships to provide solidarity in my endeavors. Real estate is not an easy market without experience and money!

## Hobbies

I enjoy everything adventurous and experiencing new things. Whether it be new ideas, new places, or pretty much new anything, I love learning and challenging myself to new things.
<br>
To be more specific about my hobbies, I enjoy anything outdoors; from hunting and fishing to hiking and camping. A fun fact about me is that I took a car-camping road trip from my home state of PA all the way to San Diego... and back! I also enjoy building things, most notably the card table my roommate and I built in the woodshop at Lehigh. I don't have many projects to my name, but I am working on a bookshelf currently.
<br>
Like most people, I value my time with friends and family, so I have to include them somewhere on my site. Any other hobbies I previously mentioned were things both my friends and family helped me enjoy doing!
